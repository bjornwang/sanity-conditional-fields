# Conditional Fields in Sanity Studio

The repository contains a clean studio created with `sanity init` with a simplest possible schema to showcase conditional fields.

## Usage instructions

1. Clone the code and point it to your own Sanity project and data set by modifying `sanity.json:
```
  "api": {
    "projectId": "iitl24hy",
    "dataset": "example"
  }
```

2. Run `sanity start` and open the Sanity Studio on http://localhost:3333/.

3. Add a new document of type **Product**.\ \
![Product with price](https://github.com/bjornwang/sanity-conditional-fields/blob/master/static/readme/1.png)

* Set a product name.
* Select **Price model** 'Paid', and a field for the price will appear.
* Set a price.
* Publish the product.\Â \
**STATUS**: The product is now saved in Sanity with a value in the price field.

4. Now edit the product.\ \
![Product without price](https://github.com/bjornwang/sanity-conditional-fields/blob/master/static/readme/2.png)

* Change the **Price model** to 'Free'. The price field will disappear.
* Publish the product.\ \
**STATUS**: The product is now saved in with the 'Free' price model, but **still has a value in the price field**.


## Questions on possible improvements

1. How can we remove the value of the conditional field in the stored document every time the field it's hidden?
In other words, in our example, when a 'Paid' product is made 'Free' so that the price field becomes hidden, how can we also unset the price field in the stored document in Sanity.

2. Can we avoid having to specify `inputComponent: ConditionalField` on every single, conditional field, and instead implement an **input resolver**. This would be a much more elegent solution. An input resolver could simply check for the presence of `options.condition` in the field definition, like this:
```
import ConditionalField from './conditional-field/ConditionalField'
export default function resolveInput(type) {
  // For any field that has 'options.condition' set
  if (type.options && type.options.condition) {
    return ConditionalField
  }
}
```
